# Data-Analytics-Project
Data Analytics Project with R
Every song has key characteristics including lyrics,
duration, artist information, temp, beat, loudness,
chord, etc. The aim of this project is to investigate
the following questions:

• Are there certain characteristics for popular
songs?

• What are the largest influencers on a song’s
success?

• Is it possible to predict popular songs with
machine learning using audio features? What is the
best performance of our machine learning models?
